\section{NICS}

Despite most people complain at the sight of a book full of equations,
mathematics is an important part of many books. Here, we shall
illustrate some of the possibilities. We believe that theorems,
definitions, remarks and examples should be emphasised with a shaded
background; however, the colour should not be to heavy on the eyes, so
we have chosen a sort of light yellow.\sidenote{The boxes are all of the
same colour here, because we did not want our document to look like
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin}{Harlequin}.}
