Having obtained a general characterization of the sunflower-type molecules, it's time to get back to the problem at hand and start looking into how they can be applied.

Let's reintroduce the molecule that motivated this whole study: saxitoxin (STX).
For the purposes of this study, the STX structure features two guanidinium moieties (which are protonated due to the simulation of acidic conditions), two hydroxyl, and one carbamate group as it can be seen in \reffig{stx-structure}.

\section{Study of adsorption}

After having characterized the spectroscopic profile of STX, it's time to assess its interactions with the members of the sunflower family, keeping in mind that the main goal of this work is determining if any of them could be a SERS substrate suitable for its detection.
The first study that must be carried out, before any spectroscopic technique can be applied, is that of adsorption: how does STX adheres to the flowers, how stable is the resulting complex, what is the nature of that interaction...
This is a crucial matter, as there's no point in calculating spectra for a system that isn't stable.

\subsection{Sampling and optimization}

In order to take into account the possible conformational variability, the STX was manually given an array of different relative positions and angles with respect to the surface of the flowers.
Following this idea, 10 different variations were modeled for each of the 18 STX-sunflower pairs, resulting in a total of 180 structures.
These various orientations will be referred to as \q{conformers}.
All of the conformers for each pairing were optimized at the M06-2X/def2SVP calculation level, and their final energies were compared in order to identify the most stable ones and discard the unstable.
Taking the STX-S08 system as an example, the relative energies of all of its generated conformers are displayed in \reftab{stx-s08-energies}.
As it can be seen, the most stable conformer (MSC) is STX-S08-1.
However, STX-S08-2, STX-S08-9 and STX-S08-7 are also close energy-wise.
A question arises, how can we determine which conformers are stable enough to be important, and which are not?

\subsection{Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics}
Our answer to this problem consisted in applying Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics to transform these energies into population fractions.
This concept essentially translates as the fraction of each conformer that would be present in a macroscopic sample at a certain temperature.
As modeled in \refeq{maxwell-boltzmann}, $p_i$ represents the population fraction of the conformer $i$, while $p_\textit{MSC}$ is the fraction of the MSC of that particular set of conformers.
As for the rest of the elements of the equation, $\varepsilon$ corresponds to the absolute energies of the systems, $N$ is the total number of conformers in each set (which is 10 in our case), $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the temperature of the system in \si{\kelvin} (which for the purposes of this study is set at \fix{\SI{298}{\kelvin}, or is it 273??}).

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    \labeq{maxwell-boltzmann}
    \frac{p_i}{p_\textit{MSC}}&=e^{\varepsilon_\textit{MSC}-\varepsilon_i/kT} \\
    \sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{p_i}{p_\textit{MSC}}&=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_i}{p_\textit{MSC}}=\frac{1}{p_\textit{MSC}} \\
    \frac{p_i/p_\textit{MSC}}{1/p_\textit{MSC}}&=\frac{e^{\varepsilon_\textit{MSC}-\varepsilon_i/kT}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{p_i}{p_\textit{MSC}}}=p_i \\
\end{split}
\end{align}

Continuing with the example, the populations for STX-S08 were computed and are displayed in \reftab{stx-s08-populations}.
As an arbitrary threshold, it was decided to filter out all of the conformers with populations lower than \SI{1}{\percent}, and to just keep studying the remaining ones.
That is, all further calculations that involve the computation of weighted mean values or spectra will only take into account conformers with populations higher than that value.

\subsection{Basis Set Superposition Error correction}
These optimization calculations have served as a way to estimate the populations of the conformers and to identify the most stable and relevant ones.
However, they cannot be used directly to obtain accurate values for the interaction energies due to the Basis Set Superposition Error (BSSE).
In this case, this error arises when the STX molecule is close to the sunflower and their basis functions overlap.
The part of STX basis functions that comes near the sunflower improves its part of the calculation, and vice versa.
This is a problem because in order to get the interaction energy we have to subtract the energy of the complex from the energies of the isolated molecules,\marginnote{
    \begin{equation}\labeq{interaction-energy}
        V_\textit{STX-flower} = E_\textit{STX-flower} - E_\textit{STX} - E_\textit{flower}
    \end{equation}
} but the former has a better calculation level than the latter.

To solve this problem, we used the counterpoise method.
For hypothetical molecules A and B, this technique estimates their BSSE by placing the basis functions of molecule A next to molecule B, right where molecule A would go in the optimized geometry of the complex.\sidecite{duijneveldt94,rosch03}
However, its nuclei are ommited, and just the energy of A is calculated using such an extended basis set.
The same process is applied to get the corrected energy of isolated B.
Finally, the same formula as in \refeq{interaction-energy} is applied to the new values, which results in the counterpoise corrected (CC) interaction energy.

All such energies were calculated for all of the STX-flower system conformers.
Their weighted averages using the population values of \reftab{maxwell-boltzmann-all} were computed, and are displayed in \reffig{counterpoise-energies}.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{counterpoise-energies}
    \caption[Counterpoise corrected interaction energies]{Counterpoise corrected interaction energies as weighted averages for all of the sets}
    \labfig{counterpoise-energies}
\end{figure}

As it can be noted, all of the systems present negative interactions energies, that is, the complex has a lower energy than the sum of the energies of its constituents.
This is a good indication that the systems are all stable and can be further studied.
All of the families (except for Se) appear to have a common tendency: the higher the amount of petals, the higher the stabilization. This could be due to the flower having a larger area and bending in a way that maximizes the interactions with the STX molecule.

\subsection{General UV spectroscopy}

Electronic spectra were calculated as described in \refsec{electronic-transition-study} and \refsec{spectra-envelope-calculation} for the most stable conformers of all of the sunflower-STX complexes.
Then, they were plotted together in order to compare their absorption ranges in \reffig{complex-uv}.

Since this work aims to propose realistic detection techniques, it's important that the systems are actually detectable and identifiable in a real setting.
With this purpose in mind, and keeping into account the usual wavelengths of commercially available lasers for Raman,\sidenote{Which is between \fix{\SI{300}{\nano\metre} and \SI{800}{\nano\metre}}} all of the complexes with absorption ranges starting below \SI{300}{\nano\metre} were filtered out.
That left us with 8 systems out of the starting 18, but they were deemed as sufficient to continue with the last part of the study.
